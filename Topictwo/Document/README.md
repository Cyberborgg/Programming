## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# Music Library Management (Topic 2)
## Brief Description of the problem  
## Description of the structure of the code 
## How to run the program 



	What problem your application solves
	A description of the structure of your program
	The documentation should contain clear instructions on how to run the project, in bullet points, under a section heading, titled, “How to run the program”. A 1-mark penalty applies if these instructions are not included, no matter how simple the execution steps are.

The problem that we have attempted to fix with this program is having easy access to music that can also be shuffled, so each time you listen, it will be different. Along with this, the songs show what artist or band made it, the album that it's apart from, and the name of the song.
For this programme, we have used a large amount of classes that hold the data for the different songs; this includes the title of the song, the year it was released, and the band or artist it is from. We have put a list of different songs with the equivalent data in them, and then in the app it is used, and then it is outputted to the user.
